### Task Description:

We are attempting the problem of **Text Entailment**, which is determining whether a piece of text logically follows from another piece of text. It is the task of **Natural Language Inference (NLI)** where given pairs of small text snippets (one or more sentences in English), known as Text-Hypothesis (T-H) pairs, we have to decide if the **hypothesis contradicts, entails or is neutral to the text.** 

In this project , we are performing a quantitative analysis of prevalent models and embeddings for the task of text entailment and we are evaluating which model and embedding is the best for the text entailment task.
