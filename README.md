### Task Description:

We are attempting the task of Text Entailment, which is determining whether a piece of text logically follows from another piece of text. It is the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) where given pairs of small text snippets (one or more sentences in English), known as Text-Hypothesis (T-H) pairs, we have to decide if the hypothesis contradicts, entails or is neutral to the text. So we have semantic classes as our target labels. This task has many semantic applications such as question answering, text summarization, information extraction, and machine translation, etc. In this13
research, we performed a quantitative analyse of prevalent models and embeddings for the task of text entailment and evaluated which model and embedding is the best for the text entailement task.
